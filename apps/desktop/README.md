# @marlen/desktop

Electron shell around the Marlen server + web app. It runs the bundled
`@marlen/server` as a utility child process on `127.0.0.1` (ports 43117+),
opens a window on it, and auto-updates from the releases of the public
`Oktami-Labs/marlen` repo (this source repo is private).
All state (SQLite DB, library, logs) lives in Electron's per-user data
directory (`~/Library/Application Support/Marlen` on macOS).

Day-to-day development doesn't involve this package — `pnpm dev` at the repo
root (browser + Vite) stays the loop. This shell only matters when working on
the shell itself or cutting a release.

## Run the shell locally

```sh
pnpm --filter @marlen/web build
pnpm --filter @marlen/desktop dev
```

`dev` assembles `build/app` (see `scripts/build.mjs`), npm-installs the
runtime deps there, rebuilds native modules against Electron's ABI, and
launches Electron. First run takes a few minutes (Electron headers +
better-sqlite3 compile); later runs are incremental.

`MARLEN_DESKTOP_SMOKE=1` makes the shell quit itself right after the window
finishes loading — a boot smoke test for CI or a headless check.

The `packageManager: "npm@…"` field in this package's package.json is
load-bearing: it tells electron-builder's node-module collector that
`build/app` is an npm-managed tree. Without it the collector detects pnpm
(from the workspace / the `pnpm dist` user agent), fails to read
`build/app/node_modules`, and silently packages only a fraction of the
runtime deps — the app then dies on `Cannot find package 'fastify'`.

## Cutting a release

1. Bump `version` in `apps/desktop/package.json`.
2. Tag and push: `git tag v0.2.0 && git push origin v0.2.0`.
3. The `release.yml` workflow builds macOS and Windows installers and
   uploads them to a **draft** release in the public `Oktami-Labs/marlen`
   repo. It authenticates with the `RELEASE_TOKEN` repo secret: a
   fine-grained PAT with Contents read/write on that one repo (the
   workflow's own `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot write elsewhere). It expires; a
   failing draft step means it needs replacing. The draft first commits a
   `VERSION` bump to that repo's `main` and targets it, because GitHub's
   "latest" release (what the updater and marlen.email resolve) is the one
   with the newest tagged commit, not the one published last.
4. Publish the release. Running apps poll every 4 hours (and on launch),
   download in the background, and show a "restart to update" toast.

## Downloads & updates

Everything a user or an installed app touches lives in the public
`Oktami-Labs/marlen` repo, which holds no source: the releases (the
electron-updater feed baked into the app via `publish` in
`electron-builder.yml`), the GitHub Pages download site on its `gh-pages`
branch (reads the latest release via the GitHub API, needs no rebuild per
release), and the issue tracker the About panel links to. Auto-update works
anonymously out of the box.

macOS quirk until builds are signed: a CI-built dmg downloaded from GitHub
carries the quarantine flag — allow it once via System Settings → Privacy &
Security → "Open Anyway" (and macOS auto-update stays off until signing).

## Signing

Unsigned status quo: **Windows** installs and auto-updates fine (Windows
shows a one-time SmartScreen warning on first install); **macOS** blocks
unsigned builds at Gatekeeper and electron-updater won't apply updates there.
`release.yml` is pre-wired — signing turns on by adding repo secrets, no
workflow changes needed.

**macOS** (Apple Developer Program, $99/yr — required for Mac distribution):

1. Create a *Developer ID Application* certificate in the Apple Developer
   portal, export it from Keychain as `.p12`.
2. Repo secrets: `MAC_CERT_P12` (the .p12, base64-encoded),
   `MAC_CERT_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`
   (appleid.apple.com → app-specific passwords), `APPLE_TEAM_ID`.
3. In `release.yml`, give the mac leg its own package step (duplicate the
   step with `if: runner.os == 'macOS'` / `'Windows'`) and set the env vars
   only there: `CSC_LINK`, `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_ID`,
   `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`. Never set them to empty
   values on the other platform — electron-builder treats an empty
   `CSC_LINK` as a certificate path and the build fails on it.
4. Done — the next tagged release is signed + notarized, and macOS
   auto-updates start working.

**Windows** (optional — removes SmartScreen; updates work without it):
Azure Trusted Signing (~$10/mo): create a Trusted Signing account +
identity validation + certificate profile in Azure, plus an app
registration with the *Trusted Signing Certificate Profile Signer* role.
Then set the `AZURE_*` secrets and uncomment the two marked blocks
(`release.yml`, `electron-builder.yml`). Once Windows builds ship signed,
keep signing — dropping back to unsigned makes the updater reject updates.

The app icon lives in `resources/`: `icon.svg` (the web logo centered on an
Apple-grid rounded tile) is the editable source, `icon.png` (1024²) is what
electron-builder consumes and converts per platform. After editing the SVG,
re-render the PNG at 1024×1024 (any SVG rasterizer, e.g. sharp).
