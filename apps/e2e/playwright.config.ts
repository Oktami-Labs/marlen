/**
 * Marlen end-to-end config.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `webServer` entry: one shared server would put every
 * worker on the same SQLite file, and a settings write in one test would change
 * what another sees. Instead each worker boots its own isolated instance from
 * the `server` worker fixture (src/server.ts), which also pins every state path
 * into a scratch folder so a run cannot touch the developer's real database,
 * agent home, or WhatsApp session.
 *
 * The app holds an SSE connection open for its whole life, so `networkidle`
 * never settles. Tests wait on locators, never on load state.
