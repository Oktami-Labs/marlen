# @marlen/e2e

End-to-end tests: a real Fastify server, a real SQLite database, and a real
browser driving the built SPA.

```sh
pnpm test:e2e            # from the repo root, builds apps/web/dist, then runs
pnpm test:e2e:ui         # same, in Playwright's UI mode
pnpm --filter @marlen/e2e exec playwright install chromium   # one-time
```

Artifacts land in `test-results/` (traces, screenshots, videos) and
`playwright-report/`; both are gitignored. `pnpm --filter @marlen/e2e report`
opens the last HTML report.

## How a run is isolated

Every Playwright **worker** boots its own server (`src/server.ts`) on its own
port, with its own scratch state folder under the OS temp dir, removed on
teardown (`E2E_KEEP_STATE=1` keeps it). There is no shared `webServer`: one
server would put every worker on the same database, and a settings write in one
test would change what another sees.

Isolation matters more here than in most apps, because Marlen's defaults point
at real user data:

| Variable                  | Default                | What a run would otherwise touch                                     |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_PATH`           | `./data/marlen.db`     | the real mail/chat/automation database                                |
| `AGENT_HOME_PATH`         | `./agent-home`         | the current `wiki/` and `knowledge/` files                            |
| `LEGACY_AGENT_HOME_PATH`  | `~/Trailin`            | migration input that may be moved into the agent home                 |
| `LIBRARY_PATH`            | `./data/library`       | migration input moved into `knowledge/`                               |
| `SKILLS_PATH`             | `./data/skills`        | migration input folded into `wiki/` as skill pages                    |
| `WHATSAPP_AUTH_PATH`      | `./data/whatsapp-auth` | the paired device session, connecting kicks the real server offline    |

The launcher sets all of them and also runs the server with its **cwd
inside the scratch folder**, so every cwd-relative default (including the `.env`
file `process.loadEnvFile()` looks for) resolves there too. Third-party
credentials are blanked in the child environment, and `ONOFFICE_API_URL` points
at a closed port so a stray CRM call cannot leave the machine.

Belt and braces: `assertIsolated` refuses to hand a server to any test if
Pipedream reports itself configured, onOffice reports credentials, or WhatsApp
reports a linked device. A green run therefore cannot have touched a live
account.

## Writing tests

- **Never wait for `networkidle`.** The SPA holds an SSE connection open for its
  whole life, so it never settles. Wait on locators; Playwright auto-waits.
- **Select through `t()`** (`src/i18n.ts`), which reads the app's own
  `locales/*.json`. Tests then follow copy edits instead of breaking on them.
  The fixtures pin the app to German, the app's default language.
- **The setup gate is pre-dismissed** by the `context` fixture, which seeds
  `localStorage`, but only keys the page has not set itself, so a test about
  what survives a reload still tests the app.
- **Tests in one worker share a server.** Name anything you create uniquely and
  clean up after yourself; do not assume an empty database (the server seeds a
  default automation at boot).
- **Tag `@mobile`** to run a test in the phone-viewport project instead of the
  desktop one. The layout swaps below `md`: the sidebar becomes a drawer that is
  translated off-screen rather than unmounted, so assert with
  `toBeInViewport()`, not `toBeVisible()`.
- **Failing tests attach the server log** automatically (`serverLogs` fixture).

## Demo recordings

`pnpm demo` (repo root) builds the web app, runs the `demo` Playwright project
(specs whose titles carry `@demo`, video always on, a 1720×1000 viewport)
against a seeded isolated server, converts each recording to MP4 under
`~/Movies/agent-demos/marlen/` next to its final screenshot, and opens it.
`pnpm demo <words>` narrows to the demos whose title contains the words;
`--no-open` skips the player. A demo spec opts into the seeded server with
`test.use({ seeded: true })`: the worker's state directory is filled with the
demo persona (`apps/server/src/services/demo/`, the same data `pnpm seed:demo`
puts into a dev instance) before the server boots, and the spec reads the
names it asserts on from that module's `DEMO` handles. Extend the fixtures
there when a demo needs more data rather than seeding inside a spec. The
default `pnpm test:e2e` skips `@demo` specs; the demo project exists only
while `DEMO` is set, which the script does.

## What is out of reach

Anything behind a third-party round trip: linking a Pipedream account, pairing
WhatsApp, reading mail, and live model or agent-tool execution. The suite covers
validation, persistence, permission grants, chat continuity, and the host/CORS
boundary. It drives what it can through the
UI (onOffice connects with a token, so its whole flow is a browser test) while
asserting the rest through the API. Chat UI cases use persisted transcript rows
or intercepted SSE responses instead of an LLM.

Two seams exist if that ever needs to change: `ONOFFICE_API_URL` already points
the CRM client at an arbitrary host, so a local mock makes the whole onOffice
tool surface testable; a Pipedream equivalent would need a base-URL override in
`integrations/pipedream/connect.ts`.
